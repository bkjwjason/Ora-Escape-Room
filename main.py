Today was an exciting day as I embarked on a mission to catch a particularly elusive Pikachu. This little electric-type Pok√©mon has been giving me quite the run-around lately, and I'm determined to add it to my collection. I heard the reason why it's so special is because of a certain marking on it.

I've been studying its movements and behavior for weeks now, and I believe I may have finally found a clue that could lead me to it. Word on the street is that this Pikachu is more active at night, and I think I might have a better chance of spotting it in the dark.

So tonight, I plan on venturing out into the forest, armed with my trusty Pok√©balls and flashlight, in hopes of finally catching this sneaky little Pok√©mon. I'm eager to put my skills to the test and see if I have what it takes to capture such an elusive creature.

I know it won't be easy, but I'm confident that with a little patience and perseverance, I'll be able to add this Pikachu to my collection in no time and find out why it's so special. Wish me luck!

Until tomorrow,
Professor Oak"""

Today I spent my morning in my lab, organizing data on Hoenn region's Pok√©mon. Suddenly, I heard a peculiar cry that I have never heard before. It sounded like a Hoenn trio's cry but I couldn't quite place it.

I immediately put down my work and started to analyze the sound. It was unlike any Pok√©mon cry I have ever heard before. It was high-pitched and had a unique tone to it.

As I listened to the cry on repeat, I started to identify certain features in the sound that reminded me of the Hoenn trio. I am certain that this cry belongs to one of them."""

Dear Diary,

Today was a challenging day in the lab. I was attacked by several types of Pokemon, and it was quite difficult to identify what type they were. However, I did notice some interesting characteristics that might help me narrow it down.

Firstly, the Pokemon that attacked me were all not very affected by Grass-type moves. Bug-type moves were not effective as well.

On the other hand, they were weak to Fire-type moves and took extra damage from Fighting-type moves. 

I am still not entirely sure what type of Pokemon I was attacked by, but with these clues, I am confident that we will be able to narrow it down. I will continue to analyze the data and hopefully, we can identify the type soon.

Best regards,
Professor Oak
